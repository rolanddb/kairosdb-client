KairosDB Client
================

The KairosDB client is a Java library that makes sending metrics and querying the KairosDB server simple.
The HttpClient class is used to push metrics or query the KairosDB server. The library uses the builder pattern to
simplify the task of creating the JSON that is used by the client.

## Sending Metrics

Sending metrics is done by using the MetricBuilder. You simply add a metric, the tags associated with the metric, and
the data points.


	MetricBuilder builder = MetricBuilder.getInstance();
	builder.addMetric("metric1")
			.addTag("host", "server1")
			.addTag("customer", "Acme")
			.addDataPoint(System.currentTimeMillis(), 10)
			.addDataPoint(System.currentTimeMillis(), 30L);
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient("myServer", 9000);
	Response response = client.pushMetrics(builder);
	client.shutdown();

## Querying Data Points

Querying data points is similarly done by using the QueryBuilder class. A query requires a date range. The start date is
required, but the end date defaults to NOW if not specified. The metric(s) that you are querying for is also required.
Optionally, tags may be added to narrow down the search.

	QueryBuilder builder = QueryBuilder.getInstance();
    builder.setStart(2, TimeUnit.MONTHS)
           .setEnd(1, TimeUnit.MONTHS)
           .addMetric("metric1")
           .addAggregator(AggregatorFactory.sumAggregator(5, TimeUnit.MINUTES));
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient("localhost", 9000);
    QueryResponse response = client.query(builder);
   	client.shutdown();

## Querying Metric Names

You can get a list of all metric names in KairosDB.

	HttpClient client = new HttpClient("localhost", 9000);
	GetResponse response = client.getTagNames();

	System.out.println("Response Code =" + response.getStatusCode());
	for (String name : response.getResults())
    {
    	System.out.println(name);
    }
  	client.shutdown();

## Querying Tag Names
Similiarly you can get a list of all tag names in KariosDB.

	HttpClient client = new HttpClient("localhost", 9000);
	GetResponse response = client.getTagNames();

	System.out.println("response=" + response.getStatusCode());
	for (String name : response.getResults())
	{
		System.out.println(name);
	}
	client.shutdown();

## Querying Tag Values
And a list of all tag values.

	HttpClient client = new HttpClient("localhost", 9000);
	GetResponse response = client.getTagValues();

	System.out.println("response=" + response.getStatusCode());
	for (String name : response.getResults())
    {
    	System.out.println(name);
    }
   	client.shutdown();
